def annoying_function(mess):

# Define better_function() here:
#    def better_function(mess):


# Here we call the annoying_function 

# Check your code by changing the value of missing_word here
#
#   missing_words = 'the final'
#   print(better_function(missing_words))



#  Your function must return the proper message, not print it.
#  We've taken care of printing it for you when print(better_function(missing_word)) is called
#  Your function must take a variable, missing_words, as a parameter
#  Spacing matters, so make sure that your function returns the proper sentence
#  exactly as in the original function, spacing and all
